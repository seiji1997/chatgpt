### delete .DS_store
.DS_Store files are hidden files macOS uses to store folder-specific metadata and settings. They are not typically meant to be deleted manually, as the operating system automatically manages them. However, if you need to remove them for some reason, you can do so using the Terminal. Here's how:

Open Terminal: You can open the Terminal application in macOS by going to "Applications" > "Utilities" and then selecting "Terminal."

Navigate to the Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to delete the .DS_Store files. For example, if you want to remove them from your desktop, you can use:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```
Replace ~/Desktop with the path to the directory you want to clean.

Delete .DS_Store Files: To delete all .DS_Store files in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use the find command along with the rm command. Run the following command:

```arduino
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
```

#Â This command will search for all .DS_Store files starting from the current directory (represented by .) and delete them.

Empty Trash (Optional): If you deleted a significant number of .DS_Store files, you can empty the Trash to free up disk space. You can do this by right-clicking on the Trash icon in the Dock and selecting "Empty Trash."

Please be careful when using the Terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory before you go ahead and execute the find and rm commands. Deleting system files can have unintended consequences, so it's generally best to leave .DS_Store files alone unless you have a specific reason to remove them.
