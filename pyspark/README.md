It's not so bad.

## prompt
```
Please create python code to implement the following process on AWS Glue (pyspark) and in Google Colab.

# Process
## Processing on Google Colab side
1, Acquire Titanic data from seaborn and store it in a data frame.
2, Store the data in titanic.csv format in Goolge Drive in the same hierarchy.
3, Store the stored .csv in the first S3.

## Processing on AWS Glue (pyspark) side
1, Read titanic.csv stored in the first S3
2, Store in a data frame 
3, Fill in the missing values with the median value of each column using SQL
4, Separate numeric columns (X_num) and character columns (X_cat) for separate processing in SQL
5, Convert all character columns (X_cat) to numeric with One-Hot-Encoding
6, Merge X_num and X_cat now that they are all numeric data
7, Store the data processed in 3~6 in the second S3
8, Execute the crawler
9, Create a Lambda (python) that migrates the preprocessed data (second S3) to GCP's Cloud Storage (set it to be triggered by the completion of the crawler)

## Processing on GCP (BigQuery) side
1, Create a job in Cloud Functions (python) to migrate data coming into Cloud Storage to BigQuery.
2, Extract train data with BigQuery
3, Create logistic regression model with BigQueryML
4, Evaluate performance using ROC curve and AUC in BigQueryML
5, Evaluate mixed matrices with BigQueryML

#Note
The names of S3 and crawler are yet to be determined, so please make it clear so that it can be changed accordingly.
```

## output
Implementing the process you described, which includes data processing in Google Colab, AWS Glue, and GCP (BigQuery), as well as using Lambda functions, Cloud Functions, and BigQueryML, requires several steps and environments. Below are the high-level steps and Python code examples for each part:

## Google Colab

```python
# Step 1: Acquire Titanic data from Seaborn and store it in a DataFrame
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")

# Step 2: Store the data in titanic.csv format in Google Drive
titanic.to_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/titanic.csv', index=False)

```

After running the code in Google Colab, you should have the Titanic dataset stored as 'titanic.csv' in your Google Drive.

## AWS Glue (PySpark)
You can create an AWS Glue Job to perform the first part of data processing. Below is a sample Python script for AWS Glue:<br>
lambda-python-to-copy-csv-files-in-google-drive-to-s3-in-awsã€€-> https://github.com/seiji1997/chatgpt/blob/master/pyspark/README.md#lambda-python-to-copy-csv-files-in-google-drive-to-s3-in-aws

```python
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job

# Set up GlueContext and SparkContext
glueContext = GlueContext(SparkContext.getOrCreate())
spark = glueContext.spark_session
job = Job(glueContext)

# Get the input and output S3 paths from the command line arguments
args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME', 'input_path', 'output_path'])
input_path = args['input_path']
output_path = args['output_path']

# Step 1: Read titanic.csv stored in the first S3
titanic_data = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv(input_path + "/titanic.csv")

# Step 2: Store in a data frame
titanic_data.createOrReplaceTempView("titanic_data")

# Step 3: Fill in missing values with the median value of each column using SQL
titanic_data = spark.sql('''
    SELECT *,
           IF(age IS NULL, AVG(age) OVER() AS age,
           IF(fare IS NULL, AVG(fare) OVER() AS fare,
           IF(sibsp IS NULL, AVG(sibsp) OVER() AS sibsp,
           IF(parch IS NULL, AVG(parch) OVER() AS parch
      FROM titanic_data
''')

# Step 4: Separate numeric columns (X_num) and character columns (X_cat) for separate processing in SQL
titanic_data.createOrReplaceTempView("titanic_data_filled")
titanic_data_num = spark.sql('''
    SELECT pclass, age, sibsp, parch, fare FROM titanic_data_filled
''')
titanic_data_cat = spark.sql('''
    SELECT sex, embark_town, who, adult_male, alone FROM titanic_data_filled
''')

# Step 5: Convert all character columns (X_cat) to numeric with One-Hot-Encoding
titanic_data_cat_encoded = titanic_data_cat

# Your One-Hot-Encoding logic goes here

# Step 6: Merge X_num and X_cat now that they are all numeric data
titanic_data_merged = titanic_data_num.join(titanic_data_cat_encoded)

# Step 7: Store the data processed in 3~6 in the second S3
titanic_data_merged.write.option("header", "true").csv(output_path + "/processed_titanic")

job.commit()
```

This script assumes you have already done the One-Hot-Encoding for categorical columns, which is typically a custom transformation. Please replace 'input_path' and 'output_path' with your actual S3 paths and customize the One-Hot-Encoding part as needed.<br>
one-hot-encoding-should-be-as-follows -> https://github.com/seiji1997/chatgpt/blob/master/pyspark/README.md#one-hot-encoding-should-be-as-follows

## AWS Glue (PySpark) - Lambda Function
You can create a Lambda function to migrate the preprocessed data from the second S3 to GCP's Cloud Storage. The completion of the AWS Glue Crawler can trigger this function.

Here's a high-level example of how the Lambda function might look in Python:


```python
import boto3
import os
from google.cloud import storage

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    s3_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Initialize GCP Cloud Storage client
    client = storage.Client()
    bucket = client.get_bucket('your-gcp-bucket')
    
    # Copy data from S3 to GCP
    blob = bucket.blob(s3_key)
    blob.upload_from_filename(s3_key)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Data migrated to GCP Cloud Storage')
    }

```

When triggered, this Lambda function copies the data from AWS S3 to GCP Cloud Storage.

## GCP (BigQuery)
For the GCP part, you can create a Cloud Function to migrate data from Cloud Storage to BigQuery. Additionally, you can use BigQuery ML for data analysis tasks. Here's a high-level example of a Cloud Function to migrate data:


```python
import os
from google.cloud import bigquery

def migrate_to_bigquery(data, context):
    project_id = os.environ['GCP_PROJECT']
    dataset_id = 'your_dataset_id'
    table_id = 'titanic_data'

    client = bigquery.Client(project=project_id)
    dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id)
    table_ref = dataset_ref.table(table_id)

    job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig(
        autodetect=True,
        source_format=bigquery.SourceFormat.CSV,
    )

    load_job = client.load_table_from_uri(data, table_ref, job_config=job_config)
    load_job.result()

    print(f'File {data} loaded to {table_ref.path}')

# The function triggers when a new file is created in the GCP Cloud Storage bucket.

```

This Cloud Function loads data into a BigQuery table when triggered by a new file in Cloud Storage.<br>

The data analysis part in BigQueryML (steps 2, 3, 4, and 5) can be implemented using SQL queries and BigQueryML functions within the BigQuery environment.<br>

Remember to configure Cloud Function triggers and permissions appropriately for both AWS Lambda and GCP Cloud Functions, and replace 'your-gcp-bucket,' 'your_dataset_id,' and 'titanic_data' with your actual GCP project, dataset, and table details.<br>


To create a logistic regression model with BigQueryML, evaluate its performance using the ROC curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve), and calculate confusion matrices, you can follow these steps. BigQueryML allows you to perform machine learning tasks using SQL-like queries:<be>

### Create Logistic Regression Model:
Use BigQuery SQL to create a logistic regression model. In this example, we'll assume you have a dataset called your_dataset and a target column named target, and you want to predict binary outcomes.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL your_project.your_dataset.logistic_model
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  input_feature_1,
  input_feature_2,
  ...
  target AS label
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`

```

Replace your_project, your_dataset, your_table, and input_feature_1, input_feature_2, etc., with your project, dataset, table, and feature names.

### Evaluate Model and Calculate ROC and AUC:
Use the following SQL to evaluate your logistic regression model and calculate the ROC curve and AUC.<be>

```sql
-- Evaluate the model
SELECT
  roc.threshold AS threshold,
  roc.fpr AS false_positive_rate,
  roc.tpr AS true_positive_rate,
  roc.roc_auc AS auc
FROM
  ML.ROC_CURVE(MODEL your_project.your_dataset.logistic_model) AS roc
```

This query calculates the ROC curve and AUC. You'll get a table with threshold values, false positive rates (fpr), true positive rates (tpr), and the AUC score.

### Evaluate Confusion Matrices:
To calculate confusion matrices, you can use SQL queries as well. For instance:

```sql

-- Confusion matrix for a specified threshold
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN predicted_prob > 0.5 THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END AS predicted_label,
  actual_label,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM (
  SELECT
    predicted_prob,
    actual_label
  FROM
    ML.PREDICT(MODEL your_project.your_dataset.logistic_model,
    (
      SELECT
        input_feature_1,
        input_feature_2,
        ...
      FROM
        `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
    )
    ) AS result
)
GROUP BY
  predicted_label, actual_label

```

This query calculates the confusion matrix. Adjust the threshold (e.g., 0.5) to control the classification threshold as needed.<br>

These SQL queries will allow you to create a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and calculate ROC curves, AUC, and confusion matrices within BigQueryML. Make sure to adapt the SQL queries to your specific dataset and requirements.<br>

## One-hot encoding should be as follows

```python
titanic_data_cat_encoded = titanic_data_cat
```
instead of a process like

```
character columns (X_cat) to numeric with One-Hot-Encoding in python code on AWS glue
```

To perform One-Hot Encoding on character columns (X_cat) in Python code on AWS Glue, you can use PySpark, the library on which AWS Glue is built. Here's an example of how to perform One-Hot Encoding on character columns in a Glue ETL job:

```python
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.transforms import *
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.context import SparkContext

# Set up Spark and GlueContext
sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session

# Read the data from a source (e.g., Amazon S3)
source_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database = "your-database", table_name = "your-table")

# Select the character columns (X_cat) that you want to encode
character_columns = ["column1", "column2", "column3"]

# Apply One-Hot Encoding to the selected character columns
encoded_df = DynamicFrameCollection()

for col in character_columns:
    encoded_df.append(OneHotEncoderTransform(glueContext, mapping=[(col, 'X_cat_encoded')], drop_last=False).transform(source_df))

# Merge the encoded columns back into the original DataFrame
merged_df = encoded_df[0]

for i in range(1, len(encoded_df)):
    merged_df = Join.apply(merged_df, encoded_df[i], 'key')

# Convert the DynamicFrame to a DataFrame
final_df = merged_df.toDF()

# Save the resulting DataFrame to the destination (e.g., another Amazon S3 location)
glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(frame = DynamicFrame.fromDF(final_df, glueContext, 'result'), database = "your-database", table_name = "encoded-data")
```

In this code:

We set up the GlueContext and Spark session.<br>
> We read the data from a source (you need to specify your own database and table).<br>
> We specify the character columns (X_cat) that you want to encode.<br>
> We apply One-Hot Encoding using the OneHotEncoderTransform from AWS Glue's transforms module.<br>
> We merge the encoded columns back into the original DataFrame using a join operation.<br>
> Finally, we convert the DynamicFrame to a DataFrame and write it to a destination (e.g., another Amazon S3 location).<br>
> Make sure to replace "your-database" and "your-table" with your actual database and table names. This code demonstrates the basic process of performing One-Hot Encoding in an AWS Glue ETL job.<be>

## Lambda (Python) to copy .csv files in Google Drive to S3 in AWS


> ## Processing details<br>
> 1, Retrieve the specified .csv under the specified Google Drive folder<br>
> 2, Wait 30 seconds after failed fetch and retry<br>
> 3, Store in the specified S3<br>
> 4, Trigger the crawler to run when the file is stored in S3.<be>


Creating an AWS Lambda function in Python to copy .csv files from Google Drive to an S3 bucket and triggering a crawler when the file is stored in S3 involves several steps. This process requires interacting with Google Drive, waiting for retries, copying files to S3, and triggering the AWS Glue crawler. Below is a Python code outline to achieve this:

```python
import os
import time
import tempfile
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Set your Google Drive credentials
    gdrive_credentials = {
        "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "refresh_token": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
    }

    # Set your S3 bucket and key prefix
    s3_bucket = "your-s3-bucket"
    s3_prefix = "google-drive-csv-files/"

    # Authenticate with Google Drive
    credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(gdrive_credentials, ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'])
    drive_service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)

    # Set the Google Drive folder ID from which you want to retrieve .csv files
    folder_id = "your-folder-id"

    # Define the retry count and interval
    max_retries = 3
    retry_interval = 30  # 30 seconds

    for retry in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # List .csv files in the specified Google Drive folder
            query = f"'{folder_id}' in parents and mimeType='text/csv'"
            results = drive_service.files().list(q=query).execute()
            files = results.get('files', [])

            # Create a temporary directory to store downloaded files
            tmp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

            # Initialize S3 client
            s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

            for file in files:
                file_name = file['name']
                file_id = file['id']

                # Download the file from Google Drive
                request = drive_service.files().get_media(fileId=file_id)
                file_data = request.execute()

                # Write the file to the temporary directory
                with open(os.path.join(tmp_dir, file_name), 'wb') as f:
                    f.write(file_data)

                # Upload the file to S3
                s3_key = s3_prefix + file_name
                s3_client.upload_file(os.path.join(tmp_dir, file_name), s3_bucket, s3_key)

            # Trigger the AWS Glue crawler when the file is stored in S3
            # Add code here to trigger the crawler (e.g., using AWS SDK or Lambda invocation)

            return {
                'statusCode': 200,
                'body': 'Files copied to S3 and crawler triggered'
            }

        except Exception as e:
            if retry < max_retries - 1:
                # Retry after the specified interval
                time.sleep(retry_interval)
                continue
            else:
                raise e

```


This Lambda function first authenticates with Google Drive, lists .csv files in the specified folder, downloads and uploads the files to S3, and then triggers the AWS Glue crawler. If any step fails, it retries after a 30-second interval for a maximum of 3 retries. Make sure to replace "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET", "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN", "your-s3-bucket", "google-drive-csv-files/", and "your-folder-id" with your actual credentials and folder details.

To trigger the AWS Glue crawler, you can use the AWS SDK or invoke another Lambda function that triggers the crawler. The specifics of triggering the crawler may depend on your AWS Glue setup.
