SQL (Structured Query Language) provides various functions that allow you to perform operations on data stored in a relational database. These functions can be categorized into several groups, including:<br>

## Aggregate Functions:<br>

COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a result set.<br>
SUM(): Calculates the sum of a numeric column.<br>
AVG(): Calculates the average of a numeric column.<br>
MIN(): Retrieves the minimum value from a column.<br>
MAX(): Retrieves the maximum value from a column.<be>

## String Functions:<br>
CONCAT(): Concatenates two or more strings.<br>
SUBSTRING(): Returns a substring of a string.<br>
UPPER(): Converts a string to uppercase.<br>
LOWER(): Converts a string to lowercase.<br>
LENGTH(): Returns the length of a string.<br>
TRIM(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.<be>

## Date and Time Functions:<br>
CURRENT_DATE(): Returns the current date.<br>
CURRENT_TIME(): Returns the current time.<br>
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(): Returns the current date and time.<br>
DATE(): Extracts the date part from a date-time value.<br>
EXTRACT(): Extracts a specific component (e.g., year, month, day) from a date-time value.<br>
DATE_ADD(): Adds a specified time interval to a date-time value.<br>
DATE_SUB(): Subtracts a specified time interval from a date-time value.<be>


## Mathematical Functions:<br>
ROUND(): Rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.<br>
CEIL(): Rounds a numeric value up to the nearest integer.<br>
FLOOR(): Rounds a numeric value down to the nearest integer.<br>
ABS(): Returns the absolute value of a numeric value.<br>
POWER(): Raises a number to a specified power.<br>
SQRT(): Calculates the square root of a number.<be>


## Conditional Functions:<br>
CASE: Allows you to perform conditional logic in SQL queries.<br>
COALESCE(): Returns the first non-null value in a list of expressions.<br>
NULLIF(): Returns null if two expressions are equal; otherwise, it returns the first expression.<be>


## Conversion Functions:<br>
CAST(): Converts a value from one data type to another.<br>
CONVERT(): Similar to CAST, used for data type conversion in some database systems.<be>


## Other Functions:<br>
IN(): Checks if a value exists in a list of values.<br>
LIKE: Compares a value to a pattern using wildcards.<br>
ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.<br>
GROUP BY: Groups rows with the same values into summary rows.<br>
HAVING: Filters the results of a GROUP BY clause based on a condition.<br>
These are some of the basic SQL functions that you can use to manipulate and retrieve data from a relational database. The specific functions available may vary slightly between different database management systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle), so be sure to consult your database system's documentation for the exact functions and syntax supported by that system.<br>
